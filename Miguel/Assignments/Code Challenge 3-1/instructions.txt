Code Challenge #3-1

In this simple code challenge, you'll see how a small background image can repeat to fill the entire page. This sort of background image is called aÂ tile.

Download this image:
 [x] Create the project Code Challenge 3-1.
 [x] Create the folder css, and in that folder create main.css.
 [x] Create the folder images, and upload the tile image to it.
 [x] Create the file index.html.
 [x] Use the HTML button to create the initial HTML content.
 [x] In main.css, create a selector block for body and add the background-image property to it.
	 [x] No need for any other properties, as the defaults will repeat the background image.
That's it, good luck!
